# BBN-FermiConstant-Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis for exploring the role of the Fermi constant in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and the Primordial Dueterium abundance.

## Description 
By making use of the open source project [Prymordial](https://github.com/vallima/PRyMordial) and observational data on primordial deuterium, helium abundance, and cosmic microwave background radiation, we aim to constrain the value of the Fermi constant and understand its implications for the early universe's evolution.
